## Overview

The purpose of this project is to use Tableau to create visualizations to present to investors. These visualizations should convince investors to help start a ride sharing program in Des Moines, using the ride sharing program currently in New York. The data is manipulated and analyzed to answer a variety of questions an investor might have about ride sharing programs.
