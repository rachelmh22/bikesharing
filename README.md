## Overview

The purpose of this project is to use Tableau to create visualizations to present to investors. These visualizations should convince investors to help start a ride sharing program in Des Moines, using the ride sharing program currently in New York. The data is manipulated and analyzed to answer a variety of questions an investor might have about ride sharing programs.

- The ride sharing program in New York is most popular in the Manhattan area since this is where bikes are checked out most commonly


## Summary

According to the visualizations created, we can see the bike sharing program is utilized in densely populated areas like Manhattan. Additionally, males are more likely to subscribe and use a ride sharing program. Based on the data, we can implement a ride sharing program by initially starting in more populated areas and offering trials to users that may prefer to commute by bike during the mornings and evenings since this is the most popular times that the bikes are utilized.

Two additional visualizations to create:
- Trip duration based on birth year
- Mapping trips with start and end station names
